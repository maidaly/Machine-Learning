# Arabic Handwritten Digits Classification TF
This folder contains an example application using TensorFlow for Android devices.This application used to classify and recognize Arabic
handwritten digits based on the training python model on this [link](https://github.com/maidaly/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Python%20Models). In the traning I used MADBase
(Modified ArabicHandwritten Digits Databases) dataset. The dataset is available for free and can be downloaded from (http://datacenter.aucegypt.edu/shazeem/) .

[Here](https://github.com/maidaly/Machine-Learning/tree/master/android%20apps/Images/Arabic_digits_app_screenshots) are more app screenshots. 

The app was tested on android 5 device with API 21.
